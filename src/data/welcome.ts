# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Brian Cao](https://anh.pw){tabindex=0}, a Frontend Engineer based in Vietnam.

I've honed my skills building complex internal management systems for [global clients](/clients){tabindex=0} across Asia, but I'm always looking for new ways to share my knowledge and passion for modern tech.

This website is my personal playground for showcasing [side projects](/showcase){tabindex=0} that fuel my inspiration and creativity.  I'm obsessed with UI/UX and constantly experimenting with cutting-edge technologies to build intuitive, beautiful interfaces.

Most of my work is open source and publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chasoft){tabindex=0}. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vBizChain){tabindex=0} where I post about tech, design, and more.

Feel free to explore my projects and [get in touch](https://twitter.com/vBizChain){tabindex=0}!

Happy coding ðŸ’˜,
Brian
